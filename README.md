# AI Sentiment Analysis

Sentiment Analysis is a binary classification problem in artificial intelligence. In this repo I will present and evaluate my
attempt to create a Sentiment Analysis model using Word2Vec/GloVe word embeddings with a Long Short-Term Memory
(LSTM) recurrent neural network as submitted. 

I intend on making further improvements to the code, any suggestions as issues/PRs are welcome.
